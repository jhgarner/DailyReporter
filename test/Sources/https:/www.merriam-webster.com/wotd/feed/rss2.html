    <strong>fawn</strong> &#149; \FAWN\&nbsp; &#149; <em>verb</em><br />
    <p>To <em>fawn</em> over someone is to court their favor by groveling or by flattering the person. <em>Fawn</em> is also sometimes used of dogs to mean “to show affection.” </p>

<p>// Still new to celebrity, the musician seemed a bit baffled by those <em>fawning</em> over her during her recent visit to her hometown.</p>

    <p>Language lovers, rejoice! If you’re the sort of person who fawns over etymology (one of the best sorts of people, in our opinion), then you’ll be glad to know the story of <em>fawn</em>: it comes ultimately from the Old English adjective <em>fægen</em> or <em>fagan</em>, meaning “glad,” by way of Old English <em>fagnian</em>, meaning “to rejoice.” Hooray! But we’re not finished yet, my dear. Note that this <em>fawn</em> is not, despite appearances, related to the noun <em>fawn</em> that refers to a young deer. For that we can thank the Latin noun <em>fetus</em>, meaning “offspring.”</p>

    <strong>kith</strong> &#149; \KITH\&nbsp; &#149; <em>noun</em><br />
    <p><em>Kith</em> is an old-fashioned term that refers to familiar friends, neighbors, or relatives. It is often used in the phrase “kith and kin,” which means “friends and relatives.”</p>

    <strong>Did you know?</strong><br />
    <p>If you’d used the word <em>kith</em> a thousand years ago, you might have been referring to knowledge, or to a homeland, or possibly to your neighbors and acquaintances. While those first two meanings of <em>kith</em> have long since fallen out of use, the word endures with a meaning very close to that “neighbors and acquaintances” one. Today <em>kith</em> appears almost exclusively in the phrase <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/kith%20and%20kin"><em>kith and kin</em></a>, meaning “friends and relatives.” (<a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/kin"><em>Kin</em></a>, another ancient word, can also refer independently to relatives.) Occasionally you will see <em>kith and kin</em> used to refer only to family members, much to the chagrin of those who despise redundancy in language.

In light of <em>tactile</em> having <em>tangere</em> for a <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/touchstone">touchstone</a>, its dual senses of “perceptible by touch” and “of, relating to, or being the sense of touch” are perfectly sensible.

    <strong>lacuna</strong> &#149; \luh-KOO-nuh\&nbsp; &#149; <em>noun</em><br />
    <p><em>Lacuna</em> is a formal word that refers to a gap or blank space in something—in other words, a missing part. When used with respect to biology, <em>lacuna</em> also refers to a small cavity, pit, or discontinuity in an anatomical structure.</p>

<p>// The absence of hemlock pollen from one stretch of the fossil record is a notable <em>lacuna</em> that suggests the tree may have once suffered from some type of blight that nearly wiped out the species. </p>

<p>// An <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/osteocyte">osteocyte</a> is a cell that is isolated in a <em>lacuna</em> of bone.</p>

    <strong>Examples:</strong><br />
    <p>“When civil war broke out in 1642, the ensuing chaos was disastrous. ... In her new novel, ‘The Manningtree Witches,’ A.K. Blakemore explores the consequences of that chaos for a group of village women through the viewpoint of a narrator named Rebecca West. West, a true historical figure, was among those prosecuted in Essex. Blakemore’s novel adheres to these events but fills in the <em>lacunae</em> in the documents.” — Lorraine Berry, <em>The Los Angeles Times</em>, 23 Aug. 2021</p>

  <p>
    <strong>Did you know?</strong><br />
    <p>If you find yourself drawing a blank when it comes to the definition of <em>lacuna</em>, it might help to imagine drawing water instead, ideally from a lake or lagoon. <em>Lacuna</em>, <em>lake</em> and <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/lagoon"><em>lagoon</em></a> all come ultimately from <em>lacus</em>, the Latin word for “lake.” Latin speakers modified <em>lacus</em> into <em>lacuna</em> to form a word meaning “pit,” “gap,” or “pool.” When English speakers borrowed the term in the 17th century, they used it to refer to a figurative gap in or missing portion of something, such as information or text. (Note that <em>lacuna</em> comes with two plural options: the Latin <em>lacunae</em> \luh-KYOO-nee\ or \luh-KOO-nye\ or the anglicized <em>lacunas</em> \luh-KOO-nuz&#92;.) <em>Lagoon</em>, meanwhile, hewed closer to the Latin <em>lacuna</em>, referring first to a shallow sound, channel, or pond near or connected to a larger body of water, and later to a shallow artificial pool or pond.    </p>

Lacuna, lake and [lagoon](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/lagoon) all come ultimately from lacus, the Latin word for “lake.” Latin speakers modified lacus into lacuna to form a word meaning “pit,” “gap,” or “pool.” When English speakers borrowed the term in the 17th century, they used it to refer to a figurative gap in or missing portion of something, such as information or text. (Note that lacuna comes with two plural options: the Latin lacunae \luh-KYOO-nee\ or \luh-KOO-nye\ or the anglicized lacunas \luh-KOO-nuz\\.) Lagoon, meanwhile, hewed closer to the Latin lacuna, referring first to a shallow sound, channel, or pond near or connected to a larger body of water, and later to a shallow artificial pool or pond.      ]]></itunes:summary><itunes:keywords>words, word, word of the day, word a day, English, language, vocabulary, dictionary, Webster, Merriam, Merriam-Webster</itunes:keywords><merriam:shortdef><![CDATA[a gap or blank space in something]]></merriam:shortdef></item><item><guid>b6c99de3-211c-4f34-ae02-2c54016efc0b</guid><title><![CDATA[Erin go bragh]]></title><link><![CDATA[https://www.merriam-webster.com/word-of-the-day/erin go bragh-2023-03-17]]></link><description><![CDATA[<font size="-1" face="arial, helvetica">

(All are rooted in Greek theós, meaning "god," which we can also thank for such religion-related terms as [theology](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/theology) and [atheism](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/atheism).). There's not a lot of literal [apotheosizing](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/apotheosize) to be had in modern English, but apotheosis is thriving in the 21st century. It can refer to the highest or best part of something, as in "the celebration reaches its apotheosis in an elaborate feast," or to a perfect example or ultimate form, as in "a movie that is the apotheosis of the sci-fi genre."  ]]></itunes:summary><itunes:keywords>words, word, word of the day, word a day, English, language, vocabulary, dictionary, Webster, Merriam, Merriam-Webster</itunes:keywords><merriam:shortdef><![CDATA[the perfect form or example of something]]></merriam:shortdef></item></channel></rss>
